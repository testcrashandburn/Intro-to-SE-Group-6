Jaylin:
    Jaylin is a small business owner that often has to use a physical product catalog magazine to order from a particular office supply seller. He doesn't enjoy having to manage his own purchase paperwork in the mail
    due to postage stamps rising in cost, and would prefer to use the internet connection he has to pay for anyway.
    He also dislikes having to manually call the company every time he needs to return a product due to poor quality. 
    Jaylin would prefer to use an online tool to buy from this seller. However, the seller doesn't have a presence on the web currently. Jaylin needs
    both the ability for the seller to create an account and for his purchase and return records to be stored digitally. 

Yi:
    Yi is an accountant working for Tradex. She frequently needs to ensure that the transactions of all the companies that are selling on Tradex have their records agreeing with her tax forms. Currently
    she has to reach out to each company by phone, but could greatly reduce the amount of labor she spends contacting each seller if she could access all their transactions in an admin transaction history. She needs
    this admin page to be secured behind a password though in order to prevent sensitive seller business information from being leaked online, as tax law requires.
