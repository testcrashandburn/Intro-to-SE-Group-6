Jaylin:
    Jaylin is a small business owner that often has to use a physical product catalog magazine to order from a particular office supply seller. He doesn't enjoy having to manage his own purchase paperwork due to getting papers out of order by accident,
    and having to manually call the company every time he needs to return a product due to poor quality. Jaylin would prefer to use an online tool to buy from this seller. However, the seller doesn't have a presence on the web currently. Jaylin needs
    both the ability for the seller to create an account and for his purchase and return records to be stored digitally.
